All of the commands are documented within an online help system.

.SH NOTES
Calcurse interface contains three different panels (calendar,
appointment list, and todo list) on which you can perform different
actions. All the possible actions, together with their associated
keystrokes, are listed on the status bar. This status bar
takes place at the bottom of the screen.
.PP
At any time, the built-in help system can be invoked by pressing the '?'
key. Once viewing the help screens, informations on a specific command
can be accessed by pressing the keystroke corresponding to that command.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
The calcurse options can be changed from the configuration menu (shown
when 'C' is hit). Three possible categories are to be chosen from : the
color scheme, the layout (the location of the three panels on the
screen), and more general options (such as automatic save before
quitting). All of these options are detailed in the configuration menu.
.PP
.SH FILES
The following structure is created in your $HOME directory the first
time calcurse is run :
.PP
.HP 10
$HOME/.calcurse/
.br
|___conf 
.br
|___apts 
.br
|___todo
.PP
The \fIconf\fP file contains the user configuration. The \fIapts\fP 
file contains all of the user's appointments, and the \fItodo\fP 
file contains the todo list.

.SH BUGS
Incorrect highlighting of items appear when using calcurse black and
white theme together with a \fB$TERM\fP variable set to
\fIxterm-color\fP. 
To fix this bug, and as advised by Thomas E. Dickey (xterm maintainer),
\fIxterm-xfree86\fP should be used instead of \fIxterm-color\fP to set 
the \fB$TERM\fP variable:
    "The xterm-color value for $TERM is a bad choice for XFree86 
     xterm because it is commonly used for a terminfo entry which 
     happens to not support bce. Use the xterm-xfree86 entry 
     which is distributed with XFree86 xterm (or the similar one 
     distributed with ncurses)."
